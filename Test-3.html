 <em>The</em> <Mark> classical</Mark>oldest British and <b>Latin</b> writing had little or <u>no space between words</u> and could be written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon">boustrophedon</a></aboustrophedon> (alternating directions). Over time, text direction <strong>(left to right)</strong> became standardized. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_divider">Word dividers</a> and <ins>terminal punctuation</ins> became common.
